Project 1

This project is a website for a small regional, semi-private airline. This airline is equivalent to JSX. In fact, I tried to "copy" JSX's webpage https://www.jsx.com/home/search

The motivation behind building this website is a project I have back home in Mexico, where there is a potential market for setting up a similar service as JSX's between large cities in Mexico with a lot of passenger flow.
